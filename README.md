## What is Machine Learning?
>The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Example: playing checkers.
---

- E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

- T = the task of playing checkers.

- P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

## Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
